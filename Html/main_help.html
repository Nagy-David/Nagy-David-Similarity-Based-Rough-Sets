<h1>Similarity Based Rough Sets</h1>
<p>
Similarity Based Rough Sets is a partial generalized Pawlakian approximation space which is based on a tolerance relation.
This relation represents the similarity of objects. The system of base sets is generated by the correlation clustering
which is a clustering technique based on a tolerance relation. The base sets contains objects that are similar to each other.
</p>
<h1>Software description</h1>
<p>The software is capable of creating the aforementioned approximation space and in this space it can approximate
arbitrary sets. With the approximation we can reveal hidden patterns and information among the data.
There are two possible ways for the user to give the input data set:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="random_points.html">Generating random two-dimensional points</a></li>
    <li>Read a dataset from a file</li>
</ol>
<br>

After getting the input points the user can use the following possibilites to control the software:

<br>

<p>
Clicking on the Generate button the given number of random points will be generated. Naturally this button cannot be used if previously the user read the dataset from a file.
    Clicking on the Run button a search algorithm (can be downloaded using this <a href="https://github.com/aszalosl/DC-CC">link</a>) is executed which finds a quasi optimal
partition. Singleton clusters represent very little information, because the system could not consider its
member similar to any other objects without increasing the value of the cost function of the correlation clustering.
Because of this, the software discards them and creates the system of base sets of without them.
After defining the base sets, the user can select a set of points for approximation by clicking on the Approximate button.
The points to be approximated can be given as an interval in the following format: start_id-end_id.
With Display Approximation button the user can check the result of the approximation.
The set to be approximated is displayed with green points, the lower approximation contains red points and the upper apporixmation is displayed with blue points.
</p>

<h1>Toolbars</h1>
With the buttons on the toolbar, the user can control how the data points are displayed in the software.

<ol>
    <li>Display points in black <img src="pic\\original_points.jpg" class="icon" ></li>
    <li>Display clusters <img src="pic\\clusters.jpg" class="icon"></li>
    <li>Display representatives (with rectangles) <img src="pic\\representatives.jpg" class="icon"></li>
    <li>Display point IDs <img src="pic\\id.jpg" class="icon"></li>
</ol>

<h1>Menu Bar</h1>



<h1>Annotation</h1>
<p>In the software, the user has the option to insert the members of the left-out singleton
clusters to any base set. Natrually, two singleton clusters cannot be merged together.
The software offers some guidelines to help the user in the decision.
The recommended base set is the one whose representative member is the closest to the member of the given singleton.
